# DE_Technical_Test

Hey there! I found it easier to upload everything onto a repository. I tracked the time spent on each test and included a screenshot of the time spent with each folder.

Feel free to explore the code and test results. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
