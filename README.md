# DE_Technical_Test

Hey there! I found it easier to upload everything onto a repository. I tracked the time spent on each test and included a screenshot of the time spent with each folder.

### Python Test:
Getting and cleaning the data took most of my time, which caused me to miss the time deadline.

I couldn't combine both datasets from:
a)	European Central Bank. Statistical Datawarehouse. Exchange Rates. Daily frequency.  https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/browse.do?node=9691296
b)	Danmark Nationalbank. EXCHANGE RATES https://www.nationalbanken.dk/en/statistics/exchange_rates/pages/default.aspx

So I only took the data from Danmark National Bank. The CSV used is DNVALD.csv 

Feel free to explore the code and test results. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
