# DE_Technical_Test

Hey there! I though it was easer to upload everything to a repository. I've tracked the time I spent on each test, with each folder there is a screenshot of the time spent.

## Time Tracking

### Python Test:
Most of my time went to getting the data and cleaning it. That's why I couldn't finish it on time.

Feel free to explore the code and test results. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
