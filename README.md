# DE_Technical_Test

Hey there! I found it easier to upload everything onto a repository. I tracked the time spent on each test and included a screenshot of the time spent with each folder.

## Additional Comments

### Python Test:
Getting and cleaning the data took most of my time, which caused me to miss the time deadline.

Feel free to explore the code and test results. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
